== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How does the WordPress Security Plugin Plugin work? =

The WordPress Security Plugin Plugin is a secure radio button form that allows you to 
add (activate) .htaccess files to your website without having to use FTP or your web host control panel. WordPress Security Plugin
 .htaccess protection is a fast one click website security solution. WPSP has built-in Backup and Restore, a File Editor, 
 a File Uploader and a File Downloader to make managing the WPSP master .htaccess files and your website security fast and simple. 

= Is WordPress Security Plugin automatically setup already? =

Yes and No. You must be using WordPress Permalinks for WPSP to work correctly (every WordPress site should be anyway). If you are not
using Permalinks then you will get a warning message the Permalinks need to be enabled when you access the BulletProof 
Security Options page. WordPress Security Plugin includes AutoMagic .htaccess file creation so that only one click is required to automatically create your .htaccess security files. WordPress Security Plugin also offers full manual control of editing the .htaccess files
using the built-in File Editor. WordPress Security Plugin is designed with everyone in mind: regular folks, Designers, Developers and 
Coders. WordPress Security Plugin is designed to work automatically for the most common WordPress installation, which is WordPress 
installed in the root website folder so there is no need to use the AutoMagic .htaccess file create buttons. WordPress Security Plugin will automatically create the correct .htaccess files for your website so if you're not sure what you have then use the AutoMagic create buttons. If your WordPress installation was in a subfolder then clicking the AutoMagic .htaccess file create buttons is essential or if you prefer to do everything manually then you would edit your .htaccess using the built-in File Editor instead of using Automagic to automatically create your .htaccess files. When in doubt just use AutoMagic and WPSP will automatically add all the correct .htaccess information for you specific website. You can edit your .htaccess files at any time using the built-in file editor so you might
 just want to use AutoMagic to save time and then do any additional edits to the  .htaccess files using the built-in .htaccess 
 file editor.

= Can I add my own .htaccess code to the WordPress Security Plugin .htaccess files? =

Yes. Of course. The secure.htaccess and wpadmin-secure.htaccess BulletProof files contain
 .htaccess code that protects your website against XSS, CSRF, Base64_encode and SQL Injection. 
 Add any additional .htaccess code to the Master .htaccess files to either add additional website
 security protection or do many other things. You can do a lot of really neat stuff with .htaccess files
 besides just adding website security protection.

= Does the WordPress Security Plugin Plugin create or write the .htaccess files? =

Yes. WordPress Security Plugin has full AutoMagic capability and still offers full manual control 
of editing the .htaccess files using the built-in file editor. The WPSP master .htaccess files have 
already been created for you. When you use the AutoMagic .htaccess file creation feature the .htaccess files
are written for your specific website with the correct RewriteRule and RewriteBase automatically added 
to your .htaccess files. You can add additional code to the master .htaccess files, edit 
 the .htaccess files or create completely new .htaccess master files from within the WordPress 
 Dashboard using the built-in WPSP File Editor - no FTP required - no Web Host Control Panel required. 
 WPSP could also just be used simply as an online .htaccess file manager. WordPress Security Plugin is designed
  to be a real time online .htaccess file editor that each website owner has complete manual control over 
  instead of just an "auto-writing" approach. AutoMagic is great, but having both AutoMagic and full manual
  editing control makes WordPress Security Plugin a great tool that offers the best website security protection
  that you can add to your WordPress website in my opinion.
